# Lemon Chicken (柠檬鸡)

A crispy, sweet, and tangy dish. This version uses pan-frying instead of deep-frying for a healthier take.

## Ingredients:
*   2 chicken breasts (about 300g), thinly sliced or pounded thin
*   1 egg, beaten
*   1/2 cup all-purpose flour or cornstarch for coating
*   2 tablespoons cooking oil
*   Lemon slices and cilantro for garnish

### For the Chicken Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine
*   A pinch of white pepper

### For the Lemon Sauce:
*   1/4 cup lemon juice (from 1-2 fresh lemons)
*   3 tablespoons honey or sugar
*   1/2 cup chicken stock or water
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water (slurry)
*   A few thin slices of lemon

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Chicken:** Combine the chicken pieces with the marinade ingredients. Let it sit for 15 minutes.
2.  **Coat the Chicken:** Dip the marinated chicken pieces into the beaten egg, then dredge them in the flour or cornstarch, shaking off any excess.
3.  **Pan-fry the Chicken:** Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Carefully place the coated chicken in the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through. Remove and drain on a wire rack.
4.  **Make the Lemon Sauce:** In a small saucepan, combine the lemon juice, honey/sugar, and chicken stock/water. Bring to a simmer.
5.  **Thicken the Sauce:** Whisk in the cornstarch slurry and continue to simmer until the sauce thickens. You can add a few thin slices of lemon to the sauce for extra flavor.
6.  **Serve:** Slice the cooked chicken into strips. Pour the warm lemon sauce over the chicken. Garnish with fresh lemon slices and cilantro. Serve immediately.
