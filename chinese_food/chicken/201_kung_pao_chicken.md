# Kung Pao Chicken (宫保鸡丁)

A classic Sichuan dish that is a balance of sweet, savory, and spicy flavors. This is a healthier, less oily version.

## Ingredients:
*   2 chicken breasts or thighs (about 300g), cut into small cubes
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   A handful of dried red chilies (adjust to your spice preference)
*   1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns (optional)
*   1/2 cup unsalted roasted peanuts
*   1 green or red bell pepper, cut into small cubes
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, sliced
*   1-inch ginger, sliced
*   2-3 scallions, cut into small pieces

### For the sauce:
*   2 tablespoons light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon black vinegar (or rice vinegar)
*   1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine (Shaoxing wine)
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   2 tablespoons water

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Chicken:** In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. Set aside for 15 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together all the sauce ingredients: light soy sauce, black vinegar, cooking wine, sugar, cornstarch, and water.
3.  **Stir-fry Chicken:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large pan over high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry until it's golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the wok and set it aside.
4.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** In the same wok, add a little more oil if needed. Add the dried red chilies and Sichuan peppercorns (if using). Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them.
5.  **Add Vegetables:** Add the garlic, ginger, and bell peppers to the wok. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until the peppers are slightly tender.
6.  **Combine and Serve:** Return the cooked chicken to the wok. Pour the sauce mixture over everything. Stir-fry until the sauce thickens and coats the chicken and vegetables. Stir in the peanuts and scallions. Give it a final toss and serve immediately with steamed rice.
