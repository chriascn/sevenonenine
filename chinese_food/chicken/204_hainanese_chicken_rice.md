A beloved dish in Singapore and Malaysia, known for its tender, poached chicken and flavorful, fragrant rice.

## Ingredients:

### For the Chicken:

*   1-2 tablespoons salt
*   A large knob of ginger (about 3 inches), sliced
*   4-5 cloves of garlic, smashed
*   2-3 scallions, tied into a knot
*   A large bowl of ice water

### For the Rice:
*   2 cups of jasmine rice, washed and drained
*   2 tablespoons chicken fat (reserved from the chicken) or cooking oil
*   3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   2 cups of the chicken poaching liquid
*   A few pandan leaves, tied into a knot (optional)

### For the Chili Sauce:
*   10 fresh red chilies
*   2 cloves garlic
*   1-inch ginger
*   2 tablespoons chicken poaching liquid
*   1 tablespoon lime juice
*   1/2 teaspoon sugar
*   A pinch of salt

### For the Ginger Sauce:
*   2-inch ginger, finely minced or grated
*   2 tablespoons cooking oil
*   A pinch of salt

## Instructions:

### Cooking the Chicken:
1.  **Prepare the Chicken:** Clean the chicken thoroughly. Rub the salt all over the chicken, inside and out. This helps to clean the skin and firm up the meat. Rinse the salt off.
2.  **Poach the Chicken:** Fill a large stockpot with enough water to fully submerge the chicken. Bring the water to a boil. Add the sliced ginger, smashed garlic, and scallion knot.
3.  Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water, breast-side up. Bring the water back to a gentle simmer.
4.  Cover the pot, turn the heat down to low, and let the chicken poach for about 40-50 minutes. Do not let the water boil vigorously. The chicken is cooked when a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 75°C (165°F), or when the juices run clear.
5.  **Ice Bath:** Once cooked, immediately remove the chicken from the pot and plunge it into the bowl of ice water. This stops the cooking process and results in silky, smooth skin. Let it cool completely for about 15-20 minutes.
6.  **Carve:** Remove the chicken from the ice bath and pat it dry. The chicken poaching liquid in the pot is your flavorful chicken stock - do not discard it. You can carve the chicken into pieces or debone it. Drizzle with a little soy sauce and sesame oil before serving.

### Cooking the Rice:
1.  **Render Chicken Fat:** Trim any excess fat from the chicken (near the cavity) and heat it in a pan or pot over low heat until the oil renders. Discard the solid bits.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In the pot you'll cook the rice in, heat the chicken fat (or oil). Add the minced garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant.
3.  **Cook the Rice:** Add the washed rice and stir for a minute to coat the grains. Transfer to a rice cooker. Add the 2 cups of chicken poaching liquid and the pandan leaves. Stir once and cook according to your rice cooker's instructions.

### Making the Sauces:
1.  **Chili Sauce:** Blend all the chili sauce ingredients together until you have a smooth consistency.
2.  **Ginger Sauce:** Place the minced ginger and salt in a small heatproof bowl. Heat the oil in a small pan until it's very hot, then carefully pour it over the ginger. It should sizzle. Stir to combine.

### To Serve:
Serve the carved chicken with the fragrant rice, a small bowl of the clear chicken broth, the chili sauce, ginger sauce, and some slices of cucumber and tomato.
