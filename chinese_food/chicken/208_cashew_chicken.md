# Cashew Chicken (腰果鸡丁)

A popular stir-fry dish that is savory with a hint of sweetness, featuring tender chicken and crunchy cashews.

## Ingredients:
*   300g chicken breast or thigh, cut into small cubes
*   1/2 cup unsalted roasted cashews
*   1/2 green bell pepper, diced
*   1/2 red bell pepper, diced
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced

### For the Chicken Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine

### For the Sauce:
*   2 tablespoons oyster sauce or hoisin sauce
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1/4 cup chicken broth or water

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Chicken:** In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with the marinade ingredients. Set aside for 15 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the sauce ingredients.
3.  **Stir-fry Chicken:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large pan over high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry until it's cooked through and lightly browned. Remove from the wok.
4.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In the same wok, add a little more oil. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant.
5.  **Cook Vegetables:** Add the diced bell peppers and stir-fry for 2 minutes until they are tender-crisp.
6.  **Combine and Serve:** Return the chicken to the wok. Pour the sauce over and stir to combine. Let the sauce bubble and thicken.
7.  **Add Cashews:** Just before serving, stir in the roasted cashews. This keeps them crunchy. Serve immediately with rice.
