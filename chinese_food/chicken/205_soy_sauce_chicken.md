# Soy Sauce Chicken (豉油鸡)

A classic Cantonese dish where chicken is poached in a sweet and savory soy sauce mixture, resulting in juicy meat and flavorful skin.

## Ingredients:
*   1 whole chicken (about 1-1.2kg)
*   1 cup light soy sauce
*   1/2 cup dark soy sauce
*   3/4 cup rock sugar or brown sugar
*   4 cups water
*   4-5 slices of ginger
*   3-4 scallions, tied into a knot
*   2 star anise
*   A small piece of dried orange peel (optional)

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Poaching Liquid:** In a stockpot large enough to hold the whole chicken, combine the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, water, ginger, scallions, star anise, and orange peel. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.
2.  **Poach the Chicken:** Carefully lower the whole chicken into the simmering liquid, breast-side down. The liquid should cover at least two-thirds of the chicken.
3.  **Cook and Baste:** Bring the liquid back to a simmer. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and let it cook for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, flip the chicken over. Continue to cook for another 15-20 minutes, basting the exposed part of the chicken with the sauce every 5 minutes.
4.  **Check for Doneness:** The chicken is cooked when a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 75°C (165°F).
5.  **Rest and Chop:** Carefully remove the chicken from the pot. Let it rest for at least 10-15 minutes before chopping it into pieces. This allows the juices to redistribute.
6.  **Serve:** Serve the chicken with a side of the poaching liquid for dipping. You can also thicken the remaining liquid with a bit of cornstarch slurry to create a thicker sauce to drizzle over the chicken and rice.
