# General Tso's Chicken (左宗棠鸡)

A popular Chinese-American dish that is sweet, slightly spicy, and tangy. This is a healthier version that is pan-fried instead of deep-fried.

## Ingredients:
*   300g chicken thigh or breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
*   1 egg, beaten
*   1/2 cup cornstarch
*   2 tablespoons cooking oil
*   A few dried red chilies
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   Steamed broccoli for serving

### For the Sauce:
*   1/4 cup chicken broth
*   3 tablespoons soy sauce
*   2 tablespoons rice vinegar
*   2 tablespoons sugar
*   1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
*   1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together all the sauce ingredients.
2.  **Coat the Chicken:** Dip the chicken pieces in the beaten egg, then dredge them in the cornstarch until well-coated.
3.  **Pan-fry the Chicken:** Heat the oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces in a single layer. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.
4.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In the same pan, add the dried red chilies, garlic, and ginger. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
5.  **Combine:** Pour the sauce into the pan and bring it to a simmer. Let it bubble for a minute until it thickens.
6.  **Finish and Serve:** Return the cooked chicken to the pan and toss to coat it with the sauce. Serve immediately with steamed broccoli and rice.
