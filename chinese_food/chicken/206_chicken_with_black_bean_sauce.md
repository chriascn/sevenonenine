# Chicken with Black Bean Sauce (豆豉鸡)

A classic Cantonese stir-fry with a savory and pungent sauce made from fermented black beans.

## Ingredients:
*   300g chicken thigh or breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
*   1/2 green bell pepper, cut into squares
*   1/2 red bell pepper, cut into squares
*   1/2 onion, cut into chunks
*   2 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1 tablespoon fermented black beans (douchi), rinsed and mashed
*   1-inch ginger, minced

### For the Chicken Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine

### For the Sauce:
*   1 tablespoon oyster sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1/4 cup chicken broth or water

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Chicken:** Combine the chicken pieces with the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Let it marinate for 15 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, mix the sauce ingredients.
3.  **Stir-fry Chicken:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry until it is lightly browned and cooked through. Remove from the wok.
4.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In the same wok, add a little more oil. Add the mashed black beans, garlic, and ginger. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
5.  **Cook Vegetables:** Add the onion and bell peppers to the wok. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are tender-crisp.
6.  **Combine and Serve:** Return the chicken to the wok. Pour in the sauce. Stir everything together until the sauce has thickened slightly and coats all the ingredients. Serve hot with rice.
