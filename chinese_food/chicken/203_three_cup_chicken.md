# Three Cup Chicken (三杯鸡)

A famous Taiwanese and Jiangxi-style dish, named for the three key ingredients used in its sauce: soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice wine.

## Ingredients:
*   500g chicken thighs or wings, cut into bite-sized pieces
*   1/4 cup soy sauce
*   1/4 cup sesame oil
*   1/4 cup Shaoxing rice wine
*   1 whole head of garlic, cloves peeled and left whole
*   10-15 slices of ginger
*   1-2 red chilies, optional
*   A large handful of fresh basil leaves
*   1 tablespoon sugar

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate Chicken:** Briefly marinate the chicken pieces with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce for 15 minutes.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat the sesame oil in a clay pot or a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the ginger slices and garlic cloves and sauté until they are fragrant and lightly browned.
3.  **Brown the Chicken:** Add the chicken pieces to the pot and stir-fry until they are lightly browned on all sides.
4.  **Add Liquids:** Pour in the soy sauce and rice wine. Add the sugar and red chilies (if using). Stir everything to combine.
5.  **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6.  **Add Basil:** Turn up the heat to high for the last minute of cooking to reduce the sauce further until it coats the chicken. Turn off the heat and stir in the fresh basil leaves until they are just wilted.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately, ideally in the pot it was cooked in, with steamed rice.
