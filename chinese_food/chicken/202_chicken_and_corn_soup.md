# Chicken and Corn Soup (鸡茸玉米羹)

A comforting and popular soup, especially loved by children.

## Ingredients:
*   1 chicken breast, finely minced or shredded
*   1 can (about 400g) cream-style corn
*   1 egg, beaten
*   2 cups chicken stock
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   A pinch of white pepper
*   1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water (cornstarch slurry)
*   Chopped scallions or cilantro for garnish
*   A few drops of sesame oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Chicken:** You can either boil the chicken breast and then shred it, or use raw minced chicken. If using raw chicken, marinate it with a little bit of light soy sauce and white pepper.
2.  **Make the Soup Base:** In a pot, combine the chicken stock and cream-style corn. Bring it to a boil over medium heat.
3.  **Cook the Chicken:** If using raw minced chicken, add it to the soup and stir to break up any clumps. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink. If using cooked shredded chicken, add it to the soup.
4.  **Season:** Season the soup with light soy sauce and white pepper.
5.  **Thicken the Soup:** Give the cornstarch slurry a stir and slowly pour it into the soup while stirring continuously. The soup will thicken.
6.  **Add the Egg:** Slowly drizzle the beaten egg into the soup in a thin stream, while gently stirring the soup in one direction. This will create beautiful egg ribbons.
7.  **Serve:** Turn off the heat. Stir in a few drops of sesame oil. Garnish with chopped scallions or cilantro before serving.
