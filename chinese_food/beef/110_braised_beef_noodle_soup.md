# Taiwanese Braised Beef Noodle Soup (红烧牛肉面)

A famous and beloved Taiwanese dish, featuring tender chunks of braised beef, a rich and savory broth, and chewy noodles.

## Ingredients:
*   500g beef shank or brisket, cut into 1.5-inch chunks
*   2 tablespoons cooking oil
*   4-5 slices of ginger
*   4-5 cloves of garlic, smashed
*   1 onion, cut into large chunks
*   2-3 scallions, cut into 2-inch pieces
*   2-3 tablespoons Doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)
*   1/4 cup soy sauce
*   2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
*   1 tablespoon rock sugar
*   1 teaspoon five-spice powder
*   2 star anise
*   1 cinnamon stick
*   6-8 cups of water or beef stock
*   4 portions of fresh or dried noodles
*   Bok choy or other green vegetables for serving
*   Pickled mustard greens and chili oil for garnish

## Instructions:
1.  **Blanch the Beef:** Place the beef chunks in a pot of cold water, bring to a boil, and cook for 2-3 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse the beef.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat the oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the ginger, garlic, onion, and scallions. Stir-fry until fragrant.
3.  **Brown the Beef:** Add the blanched beef to the pot and sear on all sides.
4.  **Build the Flavor:** Add the doubanjiang and stir-fry for a minute until the oil turns red. Pour in the Shaoxing wine. Add the soy sauce, rock sugar, five-spice powder, star anise, and cinnamon stick. Stir well to combine.
5.  **Simmer the Broth:** Pour in the water or beef stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover and cook for 2-3 hours, or until the beef is fork-tender. (Alternatively, use a pressure cooker for about 40-50 minutes).
6.  **Cook Noodles and Vegetables:** When you are ready to serve, cook the noodles according to package directions. In the last minute of cooking, add the bok choy to blanch it.
7.  **Assemble and Serve:** Drain the noodles and vegetables and place them in large soup bowls. Ladle the hot beef and broth over the noodles. Garnish with pickled mustard greens, a drizzle of chili oil, and fresh cilantro or scallions if desired.
