# Beef and Radish Stew (萝卜牛腩)

A hearty and warming Cantonese stew, perfect for cooler weather.

## Ingredients:
*   500g beef brisket, cut into 1.5-inch chunks
*   1 large white radish (daikon), about 500g, peeled and cut into large chunks
*   3-4 slices of ginger
*   2-3 scallions, white parts only
*   2 star anise
*   1 small piece of cinnamon bark
*   2 tablespoons soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon oyster sauce
*   1 tablespoon rock sugar or regular sugar
*   2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
*   4 cups of water or beef stock

## Instructions:
1.  **Blanch the Beef:** Place the beef brisket chunks in a pot of cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for 2-3 minutes to remove impurities. You will see scum forming on the surface. Drain the beef and rinse the chunks under cold water.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the ginger slices and scallion whites. Stir-fry until fragrant.
3.  **Brown the Beef:** Add the blanched beef chunks to the pot and sear on all sides until lightly browned.
4.  **Add Seasonings:** Pour in the Shaoxing wine to deglaze the pot. Add the star anise, cinnamon bark, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar. Stir to coat the beef.
5.  **Stew:** Add enough water or beef stock to cover the beef. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for at least 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender. You can also do this in a pressure cooker for about 30-40 minutes.
6.  **Add Radish:** Add the radish chunks to the pot. Make sure they are mostly submerged in the liquid. Continue to simmer for another 30-40 minutes, or until the radish is soft and has absorbed the flavors of the stew.
7.  **Serve:** Skim off any excess fat from the surface. You can thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry if you like. Serve hot in a bowl with rice.
