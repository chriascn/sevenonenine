# Beef with Bitter Gourd (苦瓜炒牛肉)

A classic Cantonese home-style dish that balances the bitterness of the gourd with the savory flavor of fermented black beans and beef.

## Ingredients:
*   250g beef sirloin or flank steak, thinly sliced
*   1 medium bitter gourd (about 300g)
*   1 tablespoon fermented black beans (douchi), rinsed and lightly mashed
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, sliced

### For the Beef Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1/2 teaspoon sugar
*   1 teaspoon oil

### For the Sauce:
*   1 tablespoon oyster sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   A dash of sesame oil
*   1/4 cup water

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Bitter Gourd:** Cut the bitter gourd in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scrape out the seeds and the white pith. Slice the gourd thinly. To reduce bitterness, you can blanch the slices in boiling salted water for 1 minute, then drain and refresh in cold water.
2.  **Marinate the Beef:** In a bowl, combine the beef slices with the marinade ingredients. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes.
3.  **Prepare the Sauce:** Mix the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
4.  **Sear the Beef:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over high heat. Add the beef slices and stir-fry until they are about 80% cooked. Remove from the wok.
5.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** In the same wok, add a little more oil. Add the garlic, ginger, and fermented black beans. Stir-fry until fragrant.
6.  **Cook Bitter Gourd:** Add the bitter gourd slices to the wok and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are tender-crisp.
7.  **Combine:** Return the beef to the wok. Pour in the sauce. Stir everything together until the sauce has thickened and coated the ingredients.
8.  **Serve:** Serve hot with steamed rice.
