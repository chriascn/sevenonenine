# Sichuan Boiled Beef (水煮牛肉)

A famous Sichuan dish known for its fiery, aromatic, and tender qualities. Beef slices are poached in a spicy broth and served under a pile of sizzling chili and peppercorns.

## Ingredients:
*   300g beef tenderloin or sirloin, thinly sliced
*   A large handful of napa cabbage, bok choy, or bean sprouts
*   4-5 cloves garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   2-3 scallions, chopped
*   3-4 tablespoons Doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)
*   1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns
*   A handful of dried red chilies, snipped into sections
*   4 cups beef or chicken stock
*   1/4 cup cooking oil

### For the Beef Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 egg white
*   1 teaspoon oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Beef:** Combine the sliced beef with the marinade ingredients. Mix well to ensure each piece is coated. This will create a velvety texture. Let it marinate for 20 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Vegetables:** Quickly blanch the napa cabbage (or other vegetables) in boiling water for a minute. Drain and place them at the bottom of a large serving bowl.
3.  **Make the Spicy Broth:** Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok or pot over medium heat. Add the doubanjiang and stir-fry until the oil turns red and fragrant. Add half of the minced garlic, ginger, and scallions. Stir-fry for another minute.
4.  Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Let it simmer for a few minutes for the flavors to meld.
5.  **Poach the Beef:** Turn the heat down to a low simmer. Gently add the marinated beef slices to the broth, piece by piece, to prevent them from clumping. Poach for 1-2 minutes until the beef is just cooked.
6.  **Assemble the Dish:** Pour the beef and the broth over the blanched vegetables in the serving bowl.
7.  **Create the Aromatic Topping:** Sprinkle the top of the beef with the remaining minced garlic, ginger, scallions, the ground Sichuan peppercorns, and the dried red chilies.
8.  **Sizzle:** Heat the remaining 1/4 cup of oil in a small pan until it is very hot and just beginning to smoke. Carefully pour the hot oil over the toppings on the beef. You should hear a dramatic sizzle as the aromas are released.
9.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with steamed rice.
