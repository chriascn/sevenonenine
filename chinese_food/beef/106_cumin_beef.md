# Cumin Beef (孜然牛肉)

A flavorful dish from the Western regions of China, characterized by the bold flavors of cumin and chili.

## Ingredients:
*   300g beef flank steak, thinly sliced
*   1/2 onion, sliced
*   1 red chili, sliced
*   A handful of cilantro, roughly chopped
*   2 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced

### For the Beef Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine

### For the Spice Mix:
*   2 tablespoons whole cumin seeds
*   1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns (optional)
*   1-2 teaspoons chili flakes (or to taste)
*   1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions:
1.  **Toast the Spices:** In a dry pan over medium heat, toast the cumin seeds and Sichuan peppercorns (if using) for a few minutes until they are fragrant. Let them cool and then coarsely grind them using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder. Mix with the chili flakes and salt.
2.  **Marinate the Beef:** In a bowl, mix the sliced beef with the marinade ingredients. Let it marinate for 15-20 minutes.
3.  **Stir-fry the Beef:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over high heat. Add the beef and stir-fry quickly until it is browned and cooked through. Remove from the wok.
4.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In the same wok, add a little more oil. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir-fry until the onion has softened.
5.  **Combine:** Return the beef to the wok. Sprinkle over the ground spice mix. Add the sliced red chili and cilantro.
6.  **Serve:** Toss everything together for another minute to ensure the beef is coated with the spices. Serve immediately.
