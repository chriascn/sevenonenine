# Mongolian Beef

A popular Chinese-American restaurant dish known for its tender beef slices coated in a savory and slightly sweet sauce.

## Ingredients:
*   300g beef flank steak, thinly sliced
*   3-4 scallions, cut into 2-inch pieces
*   1/2 onion, sliced
*   2 cloves garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced

### For the Beef Coating:
*   1 tablespoon cornstarch

### For the Sauce:
*   1/4 cup light soy sauce
*   1/4 cup water
*   2 tablespoons brown sugar
*   1 teaspoon dark soy sauce (for color)
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions:
1.  **Coat the Beef:** Toss the sliced beef with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch until each piece is lightly coated. This helps create a crispy crust.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together all the sauce ingredients until the sugar is dissolved.
3.  **Fry the Beef:** Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a wok or large pan over high heat. Carefully add the beef in a single layer (you may need to do this in batches). Fry for 1-2 minutes per side until crispy and browned. Remove from the wok and drain on paper towels.
4.  **Saut√© Aromatics:** Remove all but 1 tablespoon of oil from the wok. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir-fry for about a minute until fragrant.
5.  **Combine:** Pour the sauce into the wok and bring it to a simmer. Let it bubble for a minute or two until it starts to thicken.
6.  **Finish and Serve:** Return the crispy beef to the wok and add the scallions. Toss everything quickly to coat the beef with the glossy sauce. Serve immediately with steamed rice.
