# Beef with Satay Sauce (沙茶牛肉)

A flavorful stir-fry using Chinese Satay Sauce (Sa Cha Jiang), which is a savory and slightly spicy paste made from soybean oil, garlic, shallots, chilis, brill fish, and dried shrimp.

## Ingredients:
*   300g beef sirloin or flank steak, thinly sliced
*   1/2 onion, sliced
*   1/2 green bell pepper, sliced
*   2 cloves of garlic, minced

### For the Beef Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 teaspoon oil

### For the Sauce:
*   2 tablespoons Chinese satay sauce (Sa Cha Jiang)
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1/4 cup water

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Beef:** In a bowl, mix the beef slices with the marinade ingredients. Let it sit for 15 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, combine the satay sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and water. Mix well.
3.  **Sear the Beef:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over high heat. Add the beef and stir-fry until browned. Remove from the wok.
4.  **Sauté Vegetables:** In the same wok, add a little more oil. Add the onion and bell pepper and stir-fry for 2 minutes until slightly softened. Add the garlic and stir-fry for another 30 seconds.
5.  **Combine and Serve:** Return the beef to the wok. Pour the satay sauce mixture over the top. Stir everything together until the sauce thickens and coats the beef and vegetables. Serve immediately.
