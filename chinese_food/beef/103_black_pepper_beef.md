# Black Pepper Beef (黑椒牛肉)

A popular and flavorful dish, known for its sizzling and peppery taste.

## Ingredients:
*   300g beef sirloin or fillet, cut into small cubes
*   1/2 red bell pepper, cut into squares
*   1/2 green bell pepper, cut into squares
*   1/2 onion, cut into chunks
*   2 cloves of garlic, minced

### For the Beef Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 teaspoon oil

### For the Black Pepper Sauce:
*   2 tablespoons oyster sauce
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon tomato ketchup
*   1-2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper (adjust to taste)
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1/4 cup water

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Beef:** In a bowl, combine the beef cubes with the marinade ingredients. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together all the black pepper sauce ingredients.
3.  **Sear the Beef:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or pan over high heat. Add the beef cubes and sear until browned on all sides. Remove from the wok and set aside.
4.  **Sauté Vegetables:** In the same wok, add a little more oil if needed. Add the onion and bell peppers. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are slightly softened but still crisp. Add the minced garlic and stir-fry for another 30 seconds.
5.  **Combine and Serve:** Return the beef to the wok. Pour the black pepper sauce over everything. Stir to coat well and cook until the sauce thickens. Serve immediately, perhaps on a sizzling plate if you have one.
