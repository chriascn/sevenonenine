# Beef with Ginger and Scallions (姜葱牛肉)

A simple and classic Cantonese stir-fry, focusing on the fresh flavors of ginger and scallions.

## Ingredients:
*   300g beef flank steak or sirloin, thinly sliced
*   1 large bunch of scallions (spring onions), cut into 2-inch sections, white and green parts separated
*   2-inch piece of ginger, thinly sliced
*   2 cloves garlic, sliced

### For the Beef Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1/2 teaspoon baking soda (to tenderize the beef)
*   1 teaspoon oil

### For the Sauce:
*   2 tablespoons oyster sauce
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   A dash of white pepper
*   1/4 cup water or beef broth

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Beef:** In a bowl, mix the sliced beef with all the marinade ingredients. The baking soda is a key ingredient for tenderizing the beef. Let it marinate for at least 20 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, mix together the sauce ingredients.
3.  **Sear the Beef:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over high heat. Add the beef and quickly stir-fry until it's about 80% cooked. Remove the beef from the wok.
4.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** In the same wok, add a little more oil if needed. Add the ginger, garlic, and the white parts of the scallions. Stir-fry for about a minute until fragrant.
5.  **Combine:** Return the beef to the wok. Add the green parts of the scallions.
6.  **Add Sauce:** Pour the sauce into the wok and stir everything together quickly. Cook for another minute until the sauce has slightly thickened and the scallions are just wilted.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with steamed rice.
