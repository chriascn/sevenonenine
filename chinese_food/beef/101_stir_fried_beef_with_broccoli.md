# Stir-fried Beef with Broccoli (西兰花炒牛肉)

A classic and healthy Chinese-American dish, this homemade version is much healthier than takeout.

## Ingredients:
*   300g beef sirloin or flank steak, thinly sliced against the grain
*   1 large head of broccoli, cut into florets
*   2 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced

### For the Beef Marinade:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 teaspoon cooking oil

### For the Stir-fry Sauce:
*   2 tablespoons oyster sauce
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1/2 cup beef broth or water
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Beef:** In a bowl, combine the sliced beef with the marinade ingredients (light soy sauce, cornstarch, and oil). Mix well and set aside for at least 15 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Broccoli:** You can blanch the broccoli florets in boiling water for 1-2 minutes to ensure they are tender-crisp. Drain and set aside.
3.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together all the stir-fry sauce ingredients.
4.  **Sear the Beef:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large pan over high heat. Add the beef slices in a single layer and sear for about 1-2 minutes on each side until browned but not fully cooked. Remove from the wok and set aside.
5.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** In the same wok, add a little more oil if needed. Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant.
6.  **Combine:** Add the blanched broccoli to the wok and stir-fry for a minute. Return the seared beef to the wok.
7.  **Add Sauce and Serve:** Pour the sauce mixture over the beef and broccoli. Stir until the sauce thickens and everything is well-coated. Serve immediately with steamed rice.
