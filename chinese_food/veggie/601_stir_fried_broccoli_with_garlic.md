# Stir-fried Broccoli with Garlic (蒜蓉西兰花)

A simple, healthy, and quick vegetable dish.

## Ingredients:
*   1 large head of broccoli, cut into florets
*   3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1 tablespoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
*   1 teaspoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sesame oil
*   A pinch of sugar
*   A pinch of salt
*   2 tablespoons water or chicken/vegetable stock
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Broccoli:** Wash the broccoli florets and drain them well. You can blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, then plunge it into ice water. This helps to keep the broccoli green and crisp. Drain thoroughly.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, mix the oyster sauce, light soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and water/stock.
3.  **Stir-fry:** Heat the cooking oil in a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and stir-fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
4.  **Cook the Broccoli:** Add the broccoli florets to the wok and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are tender-crisp.
5.  **Add the Sauce:** Pour the sauce mixture over the broccoli and stir to coat everything evenly. Continue to cook for another minute until the sauce has thickened slightly.
6.  **Serve:** Transfer to a serving dish and serve immediately.
