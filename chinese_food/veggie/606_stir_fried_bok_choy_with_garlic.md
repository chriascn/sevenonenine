# Stir-fried Bok Choy with Garlic (蒜蓉小白菜)

A very simple, quick, and healthy green vegetable dish.

## Ingredients:
*   2 bunches of Bok Choy (about 500g), washed
*   3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   A pinch of salt
*   A pinch of sugar
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Bok Choy:** Wash the bok choy thoroughly. You can cut the larger bunches in half or quarters lengthwise. Drain well.
2.  **Stir-fry Garlic:** Heat the oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and stir-fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
3.  **Cook the Bok Choy:** Add the bok choy to the wok. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until the leaves start to wilt.
4.  **Season:** Add the light soy sauce, salt, and sugar. Toss everything together to coat the bok choy. You can add a splash of water if the pan gets too dry.
5.  **Serve:** Continue to cook for another minute until the stems are tender-crisp. Do not overcook. Transfer to a serving dish and serve immediately.
