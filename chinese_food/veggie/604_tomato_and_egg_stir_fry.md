# Tomato and Egg Stir-fry (番茄炒蛋)

A simple and comforting dish that is a staple in many Chinese households.

## Ingredients:
*   2 large ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges
*   3 large eggs, beaten
*   2 cloves of garlic, minced (optional)
*   1 scallion, chopped, white and green parts separated
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   A pinch of salt
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   A few drops of sesame oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Eggs:** Beat the eggs in a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and a few drops of sesame oil.
2.  **Scramble the Eggs:** Heat 1/2 tablespoon of oil in a wok or pan over medium-high heat. Pour in the beaten eggs. Gently scramble them until they are just set but still soft. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** In the same pan, add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Add the minced garlic (if using) and the white part of the scallion. Stir-fry until fragrant.
4.  **Cook the Tomatoes:** Add the tomato wedges to the pan. Sprinkle with sugar, which helps to draw out the juices from the tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes have softened and released their juices.
5.  **Combine:** Return the scrambled eggs to the pan. Add the light soy sauce. Gently toss everything together. If the dish is too dry, you can add a tablespoon or two of water.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with the green part of the scallions. Serve immediately with steamed rice.
