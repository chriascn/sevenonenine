# Buddha's Delight (Lo Han Jai - 罗汉斋)

A classic Chinese vegetarian stew, traditionally eaten on the first day of the Chinese New Year. It's packed with a variety of vegetables and other ingredients.

## Ingredients:
*   1/2 cup dried shiitake mushrooms
*   1/4 cup dried black fungus (wood ear mushrooms)
*   A handful of dried lily flowers
*   A handful of bean thread noodles (vermicelli)
*   1 block firm tofu, cut into slices and pan-fried until golden
*   1/2 cup bamboo shoots, sliced
*   1/2 cup carrots, sliced
*   1/2 cup baby corn
*   1/2 cup snow peas
*   1/2 cup napa cabbage, cut into pieces
*   1 tablespoon preserved red fermented bean curd (南乳)
*   1 tablespoon soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1 cup vegetable stock or the mushroom soaking water
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   A few drops of sesame oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Soak Dried Ingredients:** In separate bowls, soak the dried shiitake mushrooms, black fungus, and lily flowers in warm water until they are rehydrated (about 30 minutes). Squeeze out the excess water. Reserve the mushroom soaking water. Soak the bean thread noodles in warm water until soft, then drain.
2.  **Prepare Vegetables:** Tie a knot in each rehydrated lily flower. Cut the rehydrated shiitake mushrooms into slices.
3.  **Start the Stew:** Heat oil in a large pot or wok over medium heat. Add the fermented red bean curd and mash it with your spatula. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
4.  **Cook Vegetables:** Add the shiitake mushrooms, black fungus, bamboo shoots, and carrots. Stir-fry for a couple of minutes.
5.  **Simmer:** Add the vegetable stock (or mushroom soaking water), soy sauce, and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes.
6.  **Add Remaining Ingredients:** Add the pan-fried tofu, napa cabbage, baby corn, and snow peas. Cook for another 3-5 minutes until the napa cabbage is soft.
7.  **Final Touches:** Stir in the soaked bean thread noodles and lily flowers. Cook for a final minute. Drizzle with sesame oil before serving.
8.  **Serve:** Serve hot as a main vegetarian dish.
