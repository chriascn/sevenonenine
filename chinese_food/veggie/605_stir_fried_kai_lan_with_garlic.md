# Stir-fried Kai Lan with Garlic (蒜蓉芥兰)

A simple and healthy way to prepare Chinese broccoli (Kai Lan).

## Ingredients:
*   1 bunch of Kai Lan (Chinese broccoli), about 300g
*   3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1 tablespoon oyster sauce
*   A pinch of sugar
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   A splash of water or chicken stock

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Kai Lan:** Wash the Kai Lan thoroughly. Trim the tough ends of the stems. You can separate the stems and the leaves as the stems take longer to cook. If the stems are thick, you can slice them diagonally.
2.  **Blanch the Kai Lan (Optional but Recommended):** Bring a pot of water to a boil with a pinch of salt and a few drops of oil. Blanch the Kai Lan stems first for about 1 minute, then add the leaves and blanch for another 30 seconds. Remove and drain. This helps to cook the vegetable evenly and keep it green.
3.  **Stir-fry:** Heat the oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and stir-fry until fragrant.
4.  **Cook the Kai Lan:** Add the blanched Kai Lan to the wok. Stir-fry for a minute.
5.  **Add Seasoning:** Add the oyster sauce, sugar, and a splash of water/stock. Stir everything together to coat the Kai Lan with the sauce.
6.  **Serve:** Cook for another minute until the sauce has slightly thickened. Transfer to a serving plate and serve immediately.
