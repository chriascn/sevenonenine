# Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (鱼香茄子)

A classic Sichuan dish with a savory, sweet, and tangy sauce. The name "fish-fragrant" (鱼香) refers to the combination of seasonings, not the presence of fish.

## Ingredients:
*   2 long Chinese eggplants (about 400g), cut into finger-length strips
*   1 tablespoon salt (for soaking the eggplant)
*   2 tablespoons cooking oil
*   100g minced chicken or pork (optional, omit for vegetarian version)
*   3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   1 scallion, white part chopped, green part for garnish
*   1 tablespoon Doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)

### For the sauce:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon black vinegar
*   1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine
*   2 teaspoons sugar
*   1/2 cup water or vegetable stock
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Eggplant:** Place the eggplant strips in a large bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of salt. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. This draws out excess water and bitterness. Rinse the eggplant under cold water and squeeze gently to remove excess moisture. Pat dry with paper towels.
2.  **Pan-fry the Eggplant:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant strips and pan-fry until they are soft and slightly browned. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, mix all the sauce ingredients together.
4.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** In the same wok, heat another tablespoon of oil. If using minced meat, add it now and stir-fry until cooked. Add the garlic, ginger, and the white part of the scallion. Stir-fry until fragrant. Add the doubanjiang and stir-fry for another 30 seconds.
5.  **Combine and Simmer:** Return the eggplant to the wok. Pour the sauce mixture over the eggplant. Stir gently to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the eggplant is tender.
6.  **Serve:** Garnish with the green part of the scallion and serve hot with rice.
