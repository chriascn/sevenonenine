# Mapo Tofu (麻婆豆腐)

A popular Sichuan dish with a spicy and savory sauce. This version can be made healthier by using less oil and lean meat.

## Ingredients:
*   1 block of soft or medium-firm tofu (about 500g), cut into 1-inch cubes
*   100g minced chicken or pork (or minced mushrooms for a vegetarian version)
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   1-2 tablespoons Doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)
*   1 teaspoon fermented black beans (douchi), rinsed and lightly mashed
*   1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, lightly toasted and ground (optional)
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1 cup water or chicken/vegetable stock
*   1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water (cornstarch slurry)
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   Chopped scallions for garnish

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Tofu:** Gently handle the tofu. To firm it up slightly and remove the raw taste, you can blanch the tofu cubes in hot salted water for a minute. Drain and set aside.
2.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** Heat the oil in a wok or pan over medium-high heat. Add the minced meat and stir-fry until it's cooked through. Add the garlic, ginger, and doubanjiang. Stir-fry for about a minute until fragrant.
3.  **Make the Sauce:** Add the fermented black beans and ground Sichuan peppercorns (if using) and stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Pour in the water/stock, light soy sauce, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
4.  **Cook the Tofu:** Gently slide the tofu cubes into the sauce. Use a spatula to gently push the tofu around to avoid breaking it. Let it simmer for 3-5 minutes for the tofu to absorb the flavors.
5.  **Thicken the Sauce:** Give the cornstarch slurry a quick stir and pour it into the wok. Gently stir as the sauce thickens.
6.  **Serve:** Once the sauce has thickened to your liking, turn off the heat. Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with chopped scallions, and serve hot with steamed rice.
