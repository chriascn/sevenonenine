# Braised Tofu with Mushrooms (红烧豆腐)

A savory and satisfying vegetarian dish, perfect for a simple weeknight meal.

## Ingredients:
*   1 block firm tofu (about 500g), cut into 1-inch cubes or rectangular pieces
*   1 cup mixed fresh mushrooms (e.g., shiitake, button, oyster), sliced
*   2 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   1 scallion, white part chopped and green part sliced for garnish
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
*   1 teaspoon dark soy sauce (for color)
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1/2 cup water or vegetable stock
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   A few drops of sesame oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Tofu:** Pat the tofu cubes dry with a paper towel. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Pan-fry the tofu pieces until they are golden brown on all sides. This step prevents the tofu from falling apart during braising. Remove the tofu and set aside.
2.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** In the same pan, add a little more oil if necessary. Add the garlic, ginger, and the white part of the scallion. Stir-fry until fragrant.
3.  **Cook the Mushrooms:** Add the sliced mushrooms to the pan and cook until they have softened.
4.  **Braise:** Return the pan-fried tofu to the pan. Add the light soy sauce, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and water/stock. Gently stir to combine.
5.  **Simmer:** Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the tofu to absorb the flavors.
6.  **Serve:** If the sauce is too thin, you can thicken it with a cornstarch slurry (1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 2 teaspoons water). Stir in a few drops of sesame oil. Garnish with the green part of the scallions and serve hot.
