# Stir-fried Cabbage with Dried Shrimp (虾米炒包菜)

A simple, savory, and slightly sweet cabbage dish. Omit the dried shrimp for a pure vegetarian version.

## Ingredients:
*   1/2 head of cabbage, thinly sliced or torn into bite-sized pieces
*   2 tablespoons dried shrimp, rinsed and soaked in warm water for 15 minutes, then roughly chopped
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-2 dried red chilies, cut into sections (optional)
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   A pinch of salt
*   A pinch of sugar
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare:** Wash and slice the cabbage. Prepare the dried shrimp and other aromatics.
2.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** Heat the oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and dried red chilies (if using) and stir-fry until fragrant.
3.  **Add Shrimp:** Add the chopped dried shrimp and stir-fry for about a minute until they are fragrant.
4.  **Cook Cabbage:** Add the cabbage to the wok. Stir-fry for a couple of minutes until the cabbage starts to soften.
5.  **Season and Finish:** Add the light soy sauce, salt, and sugar. Continue to stir-fry until the cabbage is tender but still has a bit of crunch. You can add a splash of the shrimp-soaking water or plain water if the pan is too dry.
6.  **Serve:** Transfer to a serving dish and serve hot.
