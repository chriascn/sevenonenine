A light, healthy, and colorful dish that is very quick to cook.

## Ingredients:
*   250g large shrimp, peeled and deveined
*   1 bunch of asparagus (about 300g), tough ends trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Shrimp:** In a bowl, toss the shrimp with a pinch of salt and white pepper. Set aside.
2.  **Blanch the Asparagus:** Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the asparagus and blanch for 1-2 minutes until they turn bright green and are tender-crisp. Drain immediately and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.
3.  **Stir-fry Aromatics:** Heat the oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
4.  **Cook the Shrimp:** Add the shrimp to the wok and stir-fry until they turn pink and are cooked through, about 2-3 minutes.
5.  **Combine:** Add the blanched asparagus to the wok. Pour in the light soy sauce and sesame oil. Toss everything together to combine.
6.  **Serve:** Transfer to a serving dish and serve immediately.
