# Hot Plate Tofu with Seafood (铁板豆腐)

A popular dish at "zi char" (cook and fry) stalls in Singapore. Silky egg tofu is fried and then served with a savory gravy of minced meat and seafood on a sizzling hot plate.

## Ingredients:
*   2 tubes of egg tofu, carefully removed and cut into 1-inch thick rounds
*   1/2 cup cornstarch for dusting
*   100g minced pork or chicken
*   100g mixed seafood (prawns, squid), chopped
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   1/2 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, corn)
*   1 egg
*   A few drops of dark soy sauce
*   2 tablespoons cooking oil

### For the Gravy:
*   1.5 cups chicken or vegetable stock
*   2 tablespoons oyster sauce
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   A dash of white pepper
*   1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water (slurry)

## Instructions:
1.  **Fry the Tofu:** Gently coat the egg tofu rounds in cornstarch. Heat the oil in a pan and fry the tofu until it's golden brown on both sides. Remove and set aside.
2.  **Prepare the Hot Plate:** If you have a cast iron hot plate, heat it over the stove until it's very hot. Crack an egg onto the hot plate and add a few drops of dark soy sauce. Spread the egg around. (If you don't have a hot plate, you can make a thin omelet in a pan and place it on your serving dish).
3.  **Make the Gravy:** In a clean wok or pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant. Add the minced meat and stir-fry until cooked.
4.  Add the mixed seafood and cook until the prawns turn pink.
5.  Pour in the stock, oyster sauce, and light soy sauce. Bring to a boil. Add the mixed vegetables.
6.  **Thicken the Gravy:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry to thicken the gravy. Let it simmer for a minute.
7.  **Assemble and Serve:** Arrange the fried tofu on top of the egg on the hot plate (or serving dish). Pour the hot gravy over the tofu. The hot plate should sizzle dramatically. Serve immediately.
