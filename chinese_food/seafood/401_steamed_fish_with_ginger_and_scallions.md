# Steamed Fish with Ginger and Scallions (清蒸鱼)

A classic and healthy Cantonese dish that is simple to prepare and delicious.

## Ingredients:
*   1 whole fish (e.g., sea bass, grouper, or red snapper), about 500-600g, cleaned and scaled
*   2-3 inches ginger, thinly sliced
*   2-3 stalks scallions (spring onions), cut into long strips
*   2-3 tablespoons light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   A pinch of salt
*   A few sprigs of cilantro (coriander) for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Fish:** Rinse the fish and pat it dry with paper towels. Make a few shallow cuts on both sides of the fish. This helps the fish to cook evenly. Rub a small amount of salt over the fish.
2.  **Prepare the Aromatics:** Place half of the ginger slices and scallion strips on a heatproof plate. Place the fish on top of the ginger and scallions. Stuff the remaining ginger slices into the cavity of the fish.
3.  **Steam the Fish:** Fill a wok or a large pot with a few inches of water and bring it to a boil. Place a steaming rack in the wok/pot and carefully place the plate with the fish on the rack. Cover and steam for 8-12 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of the fish. The fish is cooked when the flesh flakes easily with a fork.
4.  **Prepare the Garnish and Sauce:** While the fish is steaming, you can prepare the remaining scallion strips. Once the fish is cooked, carefully remove the plate from the steamer. Pour off any excess liquid from the plate.
5.  **Final Touches:** Scatter the remaining scallion strips and cilantro (if using) over the fish. Heat the cooking oil in a small saucepan until it is very hot (almost smoking). Drizzle the hot oil over the scallions and fish. You should hear a sizzling sound.
6.  **Serve:** Immediately pour the light soy sauce over the fish and serve hot with steamed rice.
