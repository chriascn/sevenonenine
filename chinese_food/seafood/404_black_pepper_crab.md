# Black Pepper Crab (黑椒螃蟹)

A popular crab dish in Singapore, offering a peppery and savory alternative to Chilli Crab.

## Ingredients:
*   2 medium-sized mud crabs (about 1-1.2kg), cleaned and chopped
*   3 tablespoons butter
*   4-5 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   1 red chili, sliced
*   2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper
*   2 tablespoons oyster sauce
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1/2 cup water or chicken stock
*   A handful of curry leaves (optional but recommended)

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Crabs:** Make sure the crabs are cleaned and chopped into manageable pieces.
2.  **Make the Black Pepper Sauce:** In a small bowl, mix the black pepper, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar.
3.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In a large wok or pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger, red chili, and curry leaves (if using). Stir-fry until fragrant.
4.  **Cook the Crabs:** Add the crab pieces to the wok and stir-fry for a few minutes until they start to turn red.
5.  **Add Sauce:** Pour the black pepper sauce mixture over the crabs. Stir to coat the crabs evenly.
6.  **Simmer:** Add the water or stock. Cover the wok, reduce the heat, and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the crab is fully cooked.
7.  **Finish:** Uncover and turn up the heat to reduce the sauce until it's thick and clings to the crab pieces.
8.  **Serve:** Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.
