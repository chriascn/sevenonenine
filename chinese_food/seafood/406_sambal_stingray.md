# Sambal Stingray (叁峇魔鬼鱼)

A classic Singaporean hawker dish where stingray (or other white fish) is grilled or pan-fried, then smothered in a spicy and tangy sambal sauce. Often served on a banana leaf.

## Ingredients:
*   1 large piece of stingray wing (about 400-500g)
*   A piece of banana leaf (optional, for serving)
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   Lime wedges for serving

### For the Sambal Paste:
*   10-15 dried chilies, soaked and deseeded
*   5 shallots
*   3 cloves of garlic
*   1-inch galangal
*   2 stalks of lemongrass, white part only, sliced
*   1 teaspoon belacan (shrimp paste), toasted
*   2 tablespoons tamarind paste, mixed with 1/4 cup water and strained
*   1 tablespoon sugar
*   Salt to taste

## Instructions:
1.  **Make the Sambal Paste:** Blend the soaked chilies, shallots, garlic, galangal, and lemongrass until you get a smooth paste.
2.  **Cook the Sambal:** Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a wok or pan over medium heat. Add the blended paste and fry until it is fragrant and the oil separates from the paste (pecah minyak), about 10-15 minutes.
3.  Add the toasted belacan, tamarind juice, sugar, and salt. Continue to cook for another 5 minutes until the sambal is thick and dark red. Set aside.
4.  **Prepare the Stingray:** Pat the stingray wing dry.
5.  **Grill or Pan-fry:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil on a grill pan or a regular non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Place the stingray on the pan and cook for 4-6 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness, until it is cooked through.
6.  **Assemble:** Spread a generous layer of the prepared sambal paste over the cooked stingray. Let it cook for another minute for the flavors to meld.
7.  **Serve:** If using a banana leaf, you can briefly warm it over a flame to make it pliable and fragrant. Place the sambal stingray on the banana leaf. Serve hot with lime wedges to squeeze over the top.
