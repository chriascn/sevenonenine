# Steamed Scallops with Garlic and Vermicelli (蒜蓉粉丝蒸扇贝)

A classic Cantonese seafood dish that's often served at banquets. It's simple, elegant, and delicious.

## Ingredients:
*   8-10 large scallops in their half shells
*   A small bundle of glass noodles (bean thread vermicelli)
*   4-5 cloves of garlic, finely minced
*   2-3 scallions, finely chopped
*   1 red chili, finely chopped (for garnish)
*   2 tablespoons light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare Scallops and Noodles:** Clean the scallops and place them back in their half shells. Soak the glass noodles in warm water until soft, then drain. Cut the noodles into shorter lengths and create a small bed of noodles in each scallop shell, placing the scallop on top.
2.  **Make the Garlic Sauce:** In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic with the light soy sauce.
3.  **Assemble for Steaming:** Arrange the scallops on a heatproof plate. Spoon the garlic-soy sauce mixture over each scallop.
4.  **Steam:** Set up a steamer and bring the water to a boil. Steam the scallops over high heat for 5-7 minutes, or until the scallops are just opaque and cooked through.
5.  **Garnish and Sizzle:** Carefully remove the plate from the steamer. Sprinkle the chopped scallions and red chili over the scallops.
6.  Heat the tablespoon of cooking oil in a small saucepan until it is very hot (almost smoking). Carefully drizzle the hot oil over the scallions on each scallop. This will release the aroma of the scallions.
7.  **Serve:** Serve immediately.
