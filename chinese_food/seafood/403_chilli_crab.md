# Chilli Crab (辣椒螃蟹)

One of Singapore's national dishes. It's a glorious, messy, and delicious dish of mud crabs cooked in a sweet, savory, and spicy tomato-based sauce.

## Ingredients:
*   2 medium-sized mud crabs (about 1-1.2kg), cleaned and chopped into large pieces, claws cracked
*   A handful of fried mantou (buns) for serving
*   Cilantro for garnish

### For the Sauce:
*   1/4 cup cooking oil
*   4-5 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   2-3 scallions, white parts minced
*   2 tablespoons Doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)
*   1 cup tomato ketchup
*   1/2 cup sweet chili sauce
*   1/4 cup sugar
*   2 cups water or chicken stock
*   1 egg, lightly beaten

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Crabs:** Ensure the crabs are well-cleaned. You can ask the fishmonger to chop them for you.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat the oil in a large wok or pot over medium heat. Add the minced garlic, ginger, and the white parts of the scallions. Stir-fry until fragrant.
3.  **Add Sauces:** Add the doubanjiang and stir-fry for a minute. Then, add the ketchup, sweet chili sauce, and sugar. Stir well to combine.
4.  **Cook the Crabs:** Add the crab pieces to the wok. Stir gently to coat the crab with the sauce.
5.  **Simmer:** Pour in the water or stock. Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crab shells have turned bright red and the meat is cooked through.
6.  **Thicken the Sauce:** Uncover the wok. While the sauce is still simmering, slowly pour in the beaten egg while stirring gently. This will create lovely egg ribbons and thicken the sauce.
7.  **Serve:** Transfer the chilli crab to a large serving platter. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve immediately with hot fried mantou for dipping into the delicious sauce.
