# Fish Head Curry (咖喱鱼头)

A dish of disputed origin (South Indian, Malay, Chinese, or Peranakan), but a true Singaporean icon. A large fish head is stewed in a rich and tangy curry sauce with vegetables.

## Ingredients:
*   1 large fish head (about 700-800g), preferably from a red snapper or grouper, cleaned and cut in half
*   1/2 cup tamarind paste (asam) mixed with 1 cup of warm water, strained to get the juice
*   1 cup coconut milk
*   2 tomatoes, cut into wedges
*   4-5 okra (lady's fingers), trimmed
*   1 eggplant, cut into chunks
*   3-4 tablespoons cooking oil

### For the Spice Paste (Rempah):
*   10-15 dried chilies, soaked in hot water and deseeded
*   5 shallots, peeled
*   3 cloves of garlic, peeled
*   1-inch galangal, sliced
*   1-inch turmeric, sliced (or 1 tsp turmeric powder)
*   2 candlenuts (buah keras)
*   1 teaspoon belacan (shrimp paste), toasted

## Instructions:
1.  **Make the Spice Paste:** Blend all the ingredients for the spice paste (rempah) in a food processor or with a mortar and pestle until you have a fine paste.
2.  **Sauté the Paste:** Heat the oil in a large pot or clay pot over medium heat. Add the spice paste and fry for about 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently, until the paste is fragrant and the oil separates (pecah minyak). This step is crucial for developing the flavor of the curry.
3.  **Start the Curry:** Pour in the tamarind juice and bring to a boil.
4.  **Cook the Fish Head:** Gently place the fish head halves into the pot. Spoon some of the curry gravy over them. Cover the pot, reduce the heat, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
5.  **Add Vegetables and Coconut Milk:** Add the eggplant, okra, and tomatoes to the pot. Pour in the coconut milk. Stir gently and bring the curry back to a simmer.
6.  **Finish Cooking:** Continue to simmer for another 5-10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Season with salt and a little sugar to taste.
7.  **Serve:** Serve hot from the pot with steamed rice.
