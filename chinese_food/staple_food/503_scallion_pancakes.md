# Scallion Pancakes (葱油饼)

A savory, flaky, and chewy flatbread, a popular street food and appetizer.

## Ingredients:
*   2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
*   1 cup boiling water
*   1/4 cup cold water
*   1 cup finely chopped scallions
*   1/4 cup vegetable oil or melted lard
*   1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions:
1.  **Make the Dough:** Place the flour in a large bowl. Pour the boiling water over the flour and mix with chopsticks until a shaggy dough forms. Then, gradually stir in the cold water.
2.  **Knead and Rest:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
3.  **Shape the Pancakes:** Divide the rested dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll out one piece into a very thin rectangle.
4.  Brush the surface of the rectangle with a thin layer of oil or lard and sprinkle with salt and a generous amount of chopped scallions.
5.  **Roll and Coil:** Tightly roll the rectangle up from the long side to form a long rope. Then, coil the rope into a snail-like shape and tuck the end underneath.
6.  Gently flatten the coil with your palm, then use a rolling pin to roll it out into a circle about 1/4-inch thick.
7.  Repeat with the remaining dough.
8.  **Pan-fry:** Heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook one pancake at a time for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy.
9.  **Serve:** Let the pancake cool for a minute, then cut it into wedges. Serve with a dipping sauce of soy sauce and vinegar.
