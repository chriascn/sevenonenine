# Lor Mee (卤面)

A Hokkien noodle dish served in a thick, starchy gravy with various toppings.

## Ingredients:
*   4 portions of thick yellow noodles
*   A handful of bean sprouts
*   100g pork belly, boiled and thinly sliced
*   2 hard-boiled eggs, halved
*   A few pieces of fried fish cake or ngoh hiong, sliced

### For the Gravy:
*   6 cups pork or chicken stock
*   1/4 cup light soy sauce
*   2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon oyster sauce
*   1 tablespoon rock sugar or brown sugar
*   A dash of five-spice powder
*   1/2 cup cornstarch mixed with 1 cup of water (slurry)
*   1 egg, lightly beaten

### For the Garnish:
*   Minced garlic
*   Black vinegar
*   Chopped scallions or cilantro
*   Red chili paste

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Toppings:** Prepare all your toppings: slice the boiled pork belly, halve the eggs, and slice the fish cake.
2.  **Make the Gravy:** In a large pot, bring the stock, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, rock sugar, and five-spice powder to a boil. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes for the flavors to develop.
3.  **Thicken the Gravy:** Give the cornstarch slurry a good stir. While the stock is simmering, slowly pour in the slurry while stirring continuously until the gravy reaches a thick consistency.
4.  **Add the Egg:** Slowly drizzle the beaten egg into the gravy while stirring to create egg ribbons. Keep the gravy warm over low heat.
5.  **Cook Noodles:** In a separate pot, cook the yellow noodles and bean sprouts in boiling water for 1-2 minutes until heated through. Drain well.
6.  **Assemble and Serve:** Divide the noodles and bean sprouts among serving bowls. Ladle the hot, thick gravy over the noodles.
7.  Arrange the toppings (sliced pork, egg, fish cake) on top of the gravy.
8.  Serve immediately. Instruct the diner to add their preferred garnishes like minced garlic, a splash of black vinegar, scallions, and chili paste.
