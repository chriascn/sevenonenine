# Hokkien Mee (福建面)

The Singaporean version of Hokkien Mee is a stir-fried dish of yellow noodles and rice vermicelli in a rich and flavorful stock made from pork bones and prawn heads.

## Ingredients:
*   200g yellow noodles
*   100g rice vermicelli (bee hoon), soaked until soft
*   100g medium prawns
*   100g squid, cut into rings
*   100g pork belly, boiled and sliced
*   A handful of bean sprouts
*   A small bunch of Chinese chives (ku chye)
*   3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
*   2 eggs
*   Pork lard and crackling (optional)
*   Sambal chili and lime wedges for serving

### For the Stock:
*   500g pork bones
*   The heads and shells from the prawns
*   2 litres of water

## Instructions:
1.  **Make the Stock:** In a large pot, bring the pork bones and water to a boil. Skim off any scum. Add the prawn heads and shells. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for at least 1-2 hours to create a rich stock. Strain the stock and discard the solids. You should have about 4-5 cups of stock.
2.  **Prepare Ingredients:** Prepare all your ingredients - cook the prawns and squid in the stock for a minute until just cooked, then remove and set aside. Slice the pork belly.
3.  **Stir-fry:** Heat some oil or pork lard in a large wok over high heat. Add the garlic and stir-fry until fragrant.
4.  Crack the eggs into the wok and scramble them.
5.  **Add Noodles:** Add both types of noodles to the wok. Stir-fry for a minute.
6.  **Add Stock:** Ladle about 2 cups of the hot stock into the wok. Let the noodles simmer and absorb the stock, about 5-7 minutes.
7.  **Combine:** When most of the stock has been absorbed, add the cooked prawns, squid, sliced pork, bean sprouts, and chives.
8.  **Finish:** Stir-fry everything together until the noodles are moist but not wet.
9.  **Serve:** Serve immediately, garnished with pork crackling (if using), with a side of sambal chili and a lime wedge.
