# Wonton Noodle Soup (云吞面)

A classic Cantonese noodle dish, featuring delicate wontons and springy egg noodles in a savory broth.

## Ingredients:
*   4 portions of fresh thin egg noodles
*   A handful of choy sum or other green vegetables
*   Chopped scallions for garnish

### For the Wontons (makes about 20-25):
*   20-25 square wonton wrappers
*   150g minced pork
*   100g shrimp, peeled, deveined, and finely chopped
*   1 scallion, finely chopped
*   1 teaspoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sesame oil
*   A dash of white pepper

### For the Soup Broth:
*   6 cups chicken or pork stock
*   2-3 slices of ginger
*   Salt to taste

## Instructions:
1.  **Make the Wonton Filling:** In a bowl, combine the minced pork, chopped shrimp, scallion, soy sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper. Mix well.
2.  **Wrap the Wontons:** Place a small amount of filling in the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten the edges with water, then bring the corners together and pinch to seal, forming a small purse-like shape.
3.  **Prepare the Soup:** In a pot, bring the stock and ginger to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer. Season with salt.
4.  **Cook Noodles and Vegetables:** In a separate large pot of boiling water, cook the egg noodles until they are al dente (usually just a minute or two). In the last 30 seconds, add the green vegetables to blanch them. Drain well.
5.  **Cook the Wontons:** In the same pot of boiling water, cook the wontons until they float to the top and the filling is cooked through, about 3-4 minutes.
6.  **Assemble:** Divide the cooked noodles and vegetables among serving bowls. Top with the cooked wontons.
7.  **Serve:** Ladle the hot broth into each bowl. Garnish with chopped scallions and serve immediately.
