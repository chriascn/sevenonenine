A classic and well-loved type of Chinese fried rice. The key is to use overnight cooked rice.

## Ingredients:
*   3 cups cooked long-grain rice, preferably overnight
*   2 eggs, lightly beaten
*   100g char siu (Chinese BBQ pork), diced
*   100g small shrimp, peeled and deveined
*   1/2 cup mixed vegetables (diced carrots, peas, corn)
*   2 scallions, finely chopped
*   2 tablespoons light soy sauce
*   A dash of white pepper
*   2-3 tablespoons cooking oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare the Rice:** Use your hands to break up any clumps in the cold cooked rice.
2.  **Scramble the Eggs:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large wok or frying pan over high heat. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble them until they are just cooked. Remove from the wok and set aside.
3.  **Cook the Protein:** In the same wok, add another tablespoon of oil. Add the shrimp and stir-fry until they turn pink. Add the diced char siu and stir-fry for another minute. Remove from the wok.
4.  **Stir-fry Vegetables:** Add the remaining oil to the wok. Add the mixed vegetables and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are cooked.
5.  **Combine:** Return the rice to the wok. Stir-fry for a few minutes, tossing the rice to heat it through. Add the soy sauce and white pepper. Continue to stir-fry until the rice is evenly colored.
6.  **Finish:** Add the cooked eggs, shrimp, char siu, and chopped scallions to the wok. Toss everything together until well combined.
7.  **Serve:** Serve hot.
