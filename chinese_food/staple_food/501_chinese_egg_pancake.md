# Chinese Egg Pancake (蛋饼)

A popular Taiwanese breakfast food, this simple and delicious egg pancake is quick to make.

## Ingredients:
*   1 cup all-purpose flour
*   1 cup water
*   1/4 teaspoon salt
*   2 eggs
*   2 scallions, finely chopped
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil
*   Optional fillings: cheese, ham, tuna, or corn
*   Sauce for dipping: soy sauce paste or your favorite chili sauce

## Instructions:
1.  **Make the Batter:** In a bowl, whisk together the flour, water, and salt until you have a smooth, thin batter.
2.  **Prepare the Egg Mixture:** In a separate small bowl, crack an egg and beat it lightly with a fork. You will use one egg per pancake.
3.  **Cook the Pancake:** Heat a lightly oiled non-stick pan over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 of the batter into the pan and swirl it around to form a thin crepe. Cook for about 1-2 minutes until the top is set.
4.  **Add the Egg:** Pour one beaten egg over the crepe. Sprinkle with some chopped scallions.
5.  **Flip and Cook:** When the egg is mostly cooked, flip the pancake over. If you are adding fillings, place them on one half of the pancake now.
6.  **Fold and Serve:** Fold the pancake in half. Cook for another 30 seconds until the pancake is lightly browned.
7.  **Repeat:** Repeat the process with the remaining batter and eggs.
8.  **Serve:** Cut the pancake into smaller pieces and serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.
