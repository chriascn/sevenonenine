# Char Kway Teow (炒粿条)

A popular noodle dish in Malaysia and Singapore. Flat rice noodles are stir-fried over high heat with light and dark soy sauce, chili, shrimp, cockles, and bean sprouts.

## Ingredients:
*   500g fresh flat rice noodles (kway teow)
*   100g medium-sized prawns, peeled and deveined
*   2 Chinese sausages (lap cheong), thinly sliced
*   100g fresh cockles, cleaned (optional)
*   A large handful of bean sprouts
*   A small bunch of Chinese chives (ku chye), cut into 2-inch lengths
*   3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
*   2-3 tablespoons cooking oil
*   Pork lard (optional, for flavor)

### For the Sauce:
*   2 tablespoons light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon dark soy sauce (for color)
*   1 tablespoon sambal chili or chili paste (adjust to taste)
*   1 tablespoon ketchup
*   1 teaspoon sugar

## Instructions:
1.  **Prepare Noodles:** Gently separate the fresh flat rice noodles.
2.  **Prepare Sauce:** In a small bowl, mix all the sauce ingredients together.
3.  **Stir-fry:** Heat the oil (and pork lard, if using) in a large wok over very high heat. Add the garlic and stir-fry for a few seconds until fragrant.
4.  **Add Protein:** Add the Chinese sausage and prawns. Stir-fry until the prawns are cooked.
5.  **Add Noodles:** Add the noodles to the wok. Pour the sauce mixture over the noodles.
6.  **Toss:** Stir-fry vigorously for a few minutes, tossing the noodles to coat them evenly with the sauce. You want to get a bit of "wok hei" (breath of the wok) char on the noodles.
7.  **Finish:** Push the noodles to one side of the wok. You can crack an egg into the empty space and scramble it before mixing it with the noodles.
8.  Add the cockles (if using), bean sprouts, and Chinese chives. Give it a final quick toss for about 30 seconds. The bean sprouts should still be crunchy.
9.  **Serve:** Serve immediately.
