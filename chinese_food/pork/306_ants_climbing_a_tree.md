# Ants Climbing a Tree (蚂蚁上树)

A classic Sichuan dish with a fun name. It consists of glass noodles (bean thread vermicelli) with a savory minced pork sauce. The bits of pork clinging to the noodles resemble ants climbing a tree.

## Ingredients:
*   100g glass noodles (bean thread vermicelli)
*   150g minced pork
*   1 tablespoon Doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1 cup chicken stock or water
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   2 scallions, finely chopped
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil

### For the Pork Marinade:
*   1 teaspoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions:
1.  **Soak the Noodles:** Soak the glass noodles in warm water for about 10-15 minutes until they are soft. Drain and set aside.
2.  **Marinate the Pork:** In a bowl, combine the minced pork with its marinade ingredients.
3.  **Stir-fry Pork:** Heat the oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated pork and stir-fry, breaking up the clumps, until it is cooked through.
4.  **Add Aromatics and Sauce:** Push the pork to the side. Add the garlic, ginger, and doubanjiang. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Mix everything together with the pork.
5.  **Simmer:** Pour in the chicken stock/water, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil.
6.  **Add Noodles:** Add the soaked and drained glass noodles to the wok. Stir gently to combine with the sauce. Let the noodles cook in the sauce for a few minutes, absorbing the liquid.
7.  **Finish and Serve:** Continue to cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed by the noodles, but the dish is still moist. Stir in the chopped scallions. Serve immediately.
