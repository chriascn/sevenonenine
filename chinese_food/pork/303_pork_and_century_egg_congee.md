# Pork and Century Egg Congee (皮蛋瘦肉粥)

A classic Cantonese rice porridge that is savory, comforting, and flavorful.

## Ingredients:
*   1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed
*   8 cups water or chicken/pork stock
*   2 century eggs, peeled and roughly chopped
*   100g lean pork, thinly sliced
*   1-inch ginger, finely julienned
*   1 scallion, finely chopped
*   A pinch of salt
*   A dash of white pepper
*   A few drops of sesame oil

### For the Pork Marinade:
*   1/2 teaspoon salt
*   A pinch of white pepper
*   1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
*   A few drops of oil

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Pork:** In a small bowl, combine the sliced pork with its marinade ingredients. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Rice:** In a large pot, combine the rinsed rice and water/stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer.
3.  **Cook the Congee:** Let the congee simmer for about 1-1.5 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. The congee is ready when the rice grains have broken down and the texture is thick and creamy.
4.  **Cook the Pork:** Bring the congee to a gentle boil. Add the marinated pork slices and stir to separate them. Cook for a few minutes until the pork is cooked through.
5.  **Add Century Egg:** Stir in the chopped century eggs and half of the julienned ginger. Season the congee with salt and white pepper to your taste.
6.  **Serve:** Ladle the congee into bowls. Garnish with the remaining ginger, chopped scallions, and a drizzle of sesame oil. Serve hot.
