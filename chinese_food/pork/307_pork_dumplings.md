# Pork and Chive Dumplings (猪肉韭菜饺子)

A classic and very popular type of Chinese dumpling, perfect for boiling or pan-frying.

## Ingredients:
*   1 pack of round dumpling wrappers (about 50 wrappers)
*   300g minced pork
*   1 bunch of Chinese chives (or regular chives), finely chopped
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
*   1 tablespoon sesame oil
*   1 teaspoon salt
*   A dash of white pepper
*   1-inch ginger, grated
*   2 tablespoons water

### For the Dipping Sauce:
*   3 tablespoons black vinegar
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   A few drops of chili oil or sesame oil
*   Finely sliced ginger (optional)

## Instructions:
1.  **Make the Filling:** In a large bowl, combine the minced pork, soy sauce, wine, sesame oil, salt, pepper, and grated ginger. Stir vigorously in one direction until the mixture becomes sticky and paste-like. Gradually add the 2 tablespoons of water while stirring to make the filling juicier.
2.  **Add Chives:** Gently fold in the finely chopped chives. Don't overmix at this stage, as it can draw water out from the chives.
3.  **Wrap the Dumplings:** Place a small spoonful of filling (about 1 tablespoon) in the center of a dumpling wrapper. Moisten the edge of the wrapper with a little water. Fold the wrapper in half and pleat the edges to seal the dumpling. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.
4.  **To Boil:** Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the dumplings and cook until they float to the surface. Add about 1/2 cup of cold water to the pot and bring it back to a boil. Repeat this process two more times. This ensures the filling is cooked through.
5.  **To Pan-fry (Potstickers):** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan in a single layer. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.
6.  Pour about 1/2 cup of water into the pan (be careful of the steam), cover with a lid, and let the dumplings steam for 5-7 minutes, or until the water has evaporated.
7.  **Serve:** Mix the dipping sauce ingredients together. Serve the dumplings hot with the dipping sauce.
