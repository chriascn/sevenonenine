# Sweet and Sour Pork (咕噜肉)

A classic Cantonese dish that is loved by many. This is a healthier, baked version instead of deep-frying.

## Ingredients:
*   300g pork loin or shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon cornstarch
*   1 tablespoon flour
*   1 egg, beaten
*   1 green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares
*   1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares
*   1/2 onion, cut into chunks
*   1/4 cup pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil

### For the sauce:
*   3 tablespoons tomato ketchup
*   2 tablespoons rice vinegar
*   2 tablespoons sugar
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1/2 cup water or pineapple juice (from the can)
*   1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Pork:** In a bowl, marinate the pork with light soy sauce for 15 minutes.
2.  **Coat the Pork:** Add the beaten egg to the marinated pork and mix well. In a separate bowl, mix the cornstarch and flour. Dredge the pork pieces in the flour mixture, ensuring they are evenly coated.
3.  **Bake the Pork:** Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Place the coated pork pieces on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spray or drizzle with a little oil. Bake for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway, until the pork is golden brown and cooked through.
4.  **Prepare the Sauce:** While the pork is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, combine the ketchup, rice vinegar, sugar, light soy sauce, and water/pineapple juice. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
5.  **Thicken the Sauce:** Pour in the cornstarch slurry and stir continuously until the sauce thickens.
6.  **Stir-fry Vegetables:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and bell peppers and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are slightly tender.
7.  **Combine and Serve:** Add the baked pork and pineapple chunks to the wok. Pour the sweet and sour sauce over everything. Toss to combine and ensure everything is coated in the sauce. Serve immediately.
