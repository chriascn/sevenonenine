# Lion's Head Meatballs (狮子头)

A famous Huaiyang dish of large pork meatballs, often stewed with cabbage in a savory broth. The name comes from the large size of the meatball, said to resemble a lion's head, with the shredded cabbage as its mane.

## Ingredients:
*   500g minced pork (ideally with a 3:7 fat-to-meat ratio)
*   1/2 cup chopped water chestnuts (for texture)
*   2-3 scallions, finely chopped
*   1-inch ginger, grated
*   1 egg
*   2 tablespoons light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
*   1 tablespoon cornstarch
*   A dash of white pepper
*   1 head of napa cabbage, cut into large pieces
*   4 cups chicken or pork stock
*   2 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions:
1.  **Make the Meatball Mixture:** In a large bowl, combine the minced pork, chopped water chestnuts, scallions, ginger, egg, soy sauce, wine, cornstarch, and pepper.
2.  **Mix Well:** Stir the mixture vigorously in one direction until it becomes light, fluffy, and sticky. This incorporates air and results in a more tender meatball.
3.  **Form the Meatballs:** Divide the mixture into 4 or 6 equal portions. Wet your hands with water and form each portion into a large, smooth ball.
4.  **Brown the Meatballs:** Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Carefully place the meatballs in the pot and brown them on all sides. This helps them hold their shape during braising. Remove the meatballs from the pot and set aside.
5.  **Prepare the Braising Liquid:** In the same pot, arrange the napa cabbage pieces at the bottom. Place the browned meatballs on top of the cabbage.
6.  Pour the stock over the meatballs and cabbage. Bring to a boil.
7.  **Braise:** Once boiling, reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for at least 1 hour, or until the meatballs are cooked through and the cabbage is very tender.
8.  **Serve:** To serve, place some cabbage in a bowl and top with a giant meatball. Ladle some of the savory broth over the top.
