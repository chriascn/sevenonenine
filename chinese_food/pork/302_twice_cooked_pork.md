# Twice-Cooked Pork (回锅肉)

A famous Sichuan dish where pork is first boiled, then sliced and stir-fried with vegetables and a savory, spicy sauce.

## Ingredients:
*   300g pork belly
*   1 leek or 2-3 scallions, sliced diagonally
*   1/2 green bell pepper, sliced
*   2-3 slices of ginger
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, sliced
*   1 tablespoon Doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)
*   1 tablespoon sweet bean sauce (tianmianjiang)
*   1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
*   1 teaspoon sugar
*   1 tablespoon cooking oil

## Instructions:
1.  **First Cook:** Place the pork belly in a pot with enough cold water to cover it. Add a couple of ginger slices. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 20-30 minutes, until the pork is cooked through (a chopstick can easily pierce it).
2.  **Cool and Slice:** Remove the pork from the pot and let it cool down completely. Once cooled, slice the pork belly as thinly as possible.
3.  **Stir-fry Pork:** Heat the cooking oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced pork belly and stir-fry until the fat renders and the slices become slightly crispy and curled.
4.  **Add Sauces:** Push the pork to the side of the wok. Add the doubanjiang and sweet bean sauce to the oil and stir-fry for about a minute until fragrant. Then, mix it with the pork.
5.  **Add Aromatics:** Add the garlic and remaining ginger. Stir-fry for 30 seconds. Pour the Shaoxing wine around the rim of the wok.
6.  **Add Vegetables:** Add the leek/scallions and bell pepper. Stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Add the sugar and mix well.
7.  **Serve:** Transfer to a plate and serve hot with steamed rice.
