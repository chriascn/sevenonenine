# Shanghai-style Braised Pork Belly (红烧肉)

A classic and decadent Shanghai dish. The pork belly is slowly braised in a sweet and savory sauce until it is meltingly tender.

## Ingredients:
*   500g pork belly, skin on, cut into 1.5-inch cubes
*   2 tablespoons cooking oil
*   2 tablespoons rock sugar or brown sugar
*   1/4 cup Shaoxing wine
*   1/4 cup light soy sauce
*   2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
*   3-4 slices of ginger
*   2-3 scallions, cut into sections
*   2 star anise
*   2 cups hot water

## Instructions:
1.  **Blanch the Pork:** Place the pork belly cubes in a pot of cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for 2-3 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and set aside.
2.  **Caramelize the Sugar:** Heat the oil in a wok or heavy-bottomed pot over low heat. Add the rock sugar and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar melts and turns into a deep amber-colored caramel.
3.  **Brown the Pork:** Quickly add the blanched pork belly cubes to the pot. Be careful as the caramel may splatter. Stir-fry for a couple of minutes to coat the pork in the caramel.
4.  **Braise:** Pour in the Shaoxing wine to deglaze the pot. Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, ginger, scallions, and star anise. Add enough hot water to just cover the pork.
5.  **Simmer:** Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting. Cover and let it simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the pork is very tender and the fat is gelatinous. Check occasionally to make sure the sauce doesn't dry out.
6.  **Thicken the Sauce:** In the last 10 minutes of cooking, you can remove the lid and turn up the heat to medium to reduce and thicken the sauce until it is rich and glossy.
7.  **Serve:** Serve hot with steamed rice and some blanched green vegetables.
