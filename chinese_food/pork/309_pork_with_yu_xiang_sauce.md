# Pork with Yu Xiang Sauce (鱼香肉丝)

A classic Sichuan dish featuring shredded pork stir-fried in the famous "fish-fragrant" garlic sauce. The name comes from the sauce's flavor profile, which was traditionally used for fish dishes.

## Ingredients:
*   250g pork loin, julienned
*   1/4 cup bamboo shoots, julienned
*   1/4 cup black fungus (wood ear mushrooms), rehydrated and julienned
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1-inch ginger, minced
*   1 scallion, white parts minced, green parts sliced for garnish
*   1 tablespoon Doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)

### For the Pork Marinade:
*   1 teaspoon light soy sauce
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1 teaspoon oil

### For the Yu Xiang Sauce:
*   1 tablespoon light soy sauce
*   1 tablespoon black vinegar
*   1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
*   2 teaspoons sugar
*   1 teaspoon cornstarch
*   1/4 cup water or chicken stock

## Instructions:
1.  **Marinate the Pork:** In a bowl, combine the julienned pork with the marinade ingredients. Let it sit for 15 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, mix together all the Yu Xiang sauce ingredients.
3.  **Stir-fry Pork:** Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over high heat. Add the pork and stir-fry until it changes color and is just cooked through. Remove from the wok.
4.  **Sauté Aromatics:** In the same wok, add a little more oil. Add the doubanjiang and stir-fry until the oil is red and fragrant. Add the garlic, ginger, and the white part of the scallion. Stir-fry for 30 seconds.
5.  **Add Vegetables:** Add the julienned black fungus and bamboo shoots. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes.
6.  **Combine and Serve:** Return the pork to the wok. Pour the prepared sauce into the wok. Stir everything together quickly as the sauce thickens. Garnish with the green scallion slices and serve immediately.
